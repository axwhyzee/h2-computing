There are 2 parts to this question: a linked list and a binary search tree (BST)

1) Implement a linked list where each Node has 2 attributes: `data: int` and a `pointer: Node`

2) Implement a BST

3) Within the linked list class, implement a function `build_bst_from_segment(start: int, end: int)` that takes a segment of the linked list from between indexes `start` (inclusive) and `end` (exclusive), then construct a min height BST by inserting these values in a specific order
